# Django + Vue

This is my learning project to get my hands dirty with Django Web Framework and Vue.js

I don't expect this to be a really super amazing project but do expect that by the end of this project,
I'll have some good understanding about both the technologies

## Dockerized development

Along the way we'll try to do the entire development inside Docker containers to learn another super amazing tech

More to come...

Note to self - Had a weird observation, even after exposing the port from the docker container, binding 0.0.0.0 addr, still was not able to connect to the app from the host machine

Had the add `0.0.0.0:8000` to the runserver command to be able to access it..
